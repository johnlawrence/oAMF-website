### Introduction
The **Open Argument Mining Framework (oAMF)** is a modular, open-source framework designed to enable the creation and execution of Argument Mining (AM) workflows. It integrates multiple modules, allowing flexibility and scalability across different AM tasks. This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to install and use oAMF, develop new modules, and integrate them into a seamless pipeline for argument mining.

### Web Interface
The web interface allows users to execute pre-built pipelines on the oAMF server without needing to manually configure them. You can upload input data and run the pipeline directly from the web.
